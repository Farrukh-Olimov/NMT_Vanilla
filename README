This is vanilla neural machine translation architecture based on 'Learning Phrase Representation using RNN Encoder-Decoder for SMT'

Details: 

Vocablary limit         : 12.000 words 
Sentence Length limit   : 50 words  
Embedding dimensionts   : 300 dims 
English Embedding       : GLOVE 300d
Russian Embedding       : Self-trained 300d



Sentences are fitted in reverse order to minimize 'minimal time lag'
